# Home Assistant App: Red Reactor Battery Monitor

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the app installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant front-end to **Settings** -> **Apps**.
2. Find the "Red Reactor Battery Monitor" app and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

The app has a couple of things that must be configured to get the app running as desired:

1. Configure the MQTT settings.
2. Update app settings to suit your needs.
3. Start the app.
4. Check the app log output to see the result.
5. If MQTT Auto Discovery is enabled, the Red Reactor should appear within your Device list

## Configuration

App configuration:

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: core-mosquitto # IP Address of your MQTT Broker (optional)
  port: 1883 # Port of your MQTT Broker (optional)
  user: redreactor # Username for your MQTT Broker (optional)
  password: redreactor # Password for your MQTT Broker (optional)
  client_id: redreactor-pi # MQTT client ID, must be unique on the broker (optional)
  tls:
    enabled: false # Encrypt the MQTT connection
    ca_certs: /ssl/ca.crt # CA certificate, leave out to use the system ones (optional)
    certfile: /ssl/client.crt # Client certificate login only (optional)
    keyfile: /ssl/client.key # Client certificate login only (optional)
    insecure: false # Skip the hostname check, for testing only (optional)
hostname:
  name: redreactor-pi # Hostname (used as a MQTT topic level, so no /, + or #)
  pretty: Raspberry Pi # Pretty Display Name
homeassistant:
  discovery: true # Create the Red Reactor device in Home Assistant (optional)
  discovery_interval: 120 # Home Assistant Configuration discovery push interval (seconds, 1 or more)
  expire_after: 120 # Home Assistant MQTT Data expiry time (seconds, 0 or more)
ina:
  address: 64 # I2C address of the Red Reactor, 64 is 0x40, from 3 to 119 (optional)
  monitor_interval: 5 # Seconds between battery readings, 1 to 60 (optional)
system:
  shutdown: ha host shutdown # Shutdown (if using HASS OS, this doesn't need changing)
  restart: ha host restart # Restart (if using HASS OS, this doesn't need changing)
logging:
  console: INFO
  file: WARNING
```

If you use the Mosquitto broker app, leave `broker`, `user` and `password` empty: the app picks up the broker address and credentials from the Supervisor. Anything you set yourself is used instead.

If the broker can't be reached, the app keeps retrying rather than stopping.

Certificates for TLS go in the Home Assistant `/ssl` folder, which the app can read. Use port `8883` (or whatever your broker uses for TLS) with `tls.enabled: true`.

Other configuration options are available from within the Home Assistant Device configuration page:

- **Battery shutdown level**: when the battery drops to this percentage while running on battery, the Red Reactor safely shuts down Home Assistant. If Home Assistant starts up below this level while the battery is charging, it stays on.
- **Report interval**, and the battery voltage minimum and maximum used to work out the battery level.

The device also shows the power drawn from the battery, and whether it is charging.

## OS Specific I2C configuration

_Depending on the operating system you are using, the configuration may differ as below._

### Home Assistant OS

When using the Home Assistant OS, you must enable I2C. This can be enabled by following the steps from within this [Home Assistant guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#enable-i2c).

_The default configuration for this OS is for UART to be disabled - for the Red Reactor to power your Raspberry Pi, it must be enabled. This is due to the Red Reactor requiring UART assertion. It can be found at the same time as configuring the I2C settings, within the `hassos-boot` partition in `config.txt`. Enable it by adding `enable_uart=1` to the `config.txt`_

### Ubuntu

When using a standard operating system, I2C usually comes enabled. Meaning there is no additional configuration to get the Red Reactor working. If it is not enabled it can be done by ensuring the parameter `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` is contained within `/boot/config.txt` file.
